### ImageJ processing macros to make creating IF figures a little easier

# multi-image-processing
This macro is designed to allow for uniform histogram adjustments of a single
frame for 1-4 channels.

Currently, it recognises DAPI, GFP, mCherry or Cy5 within the file name and
colours the image blue, green, magenta, or red, respectively.

To adjust the output image intensity, alter the setMinAndMax command
